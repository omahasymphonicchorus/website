Dave Gardner’s music, ranging from choral to larger orchestral works, has been performed internationally at various festivals, competitions, and recitals by churches, children's choruses, community choirs, high schools, colleges and professional organizations to include such ensembles as the Boston Children’s Chorus, The William Baker Festival Singers, and the Heritage Singers of Minot, North Dakota, and locally by the Grace University Chorale of Omaha, University of Nebraska at Omaha, the Nebraska Choral Arts Society Masterworks and Children’s Choruses, the Solid Brass Quartet, the Mahr String Quartet, and Presbyterian Church of the Cross.

Mr. Gardner, currently the Composer-in-Residence for the Omaha Symphonic Chorus of Omaha, Nebraska, believes that the greatest innovation and challenge for the modern composer is not just the creation of something new, but of something unique, accessible, and enduring. As a result, his deeply introspective, beautifully melodic and moving compositional style appeals to a wide range of audiences and performers. He continues to explore original concepts of music composition including Story-Composing, the simultaneous composition of music and poetic narrative.  Additionally, he enjoys working with local poets and organizations to collaboratively create original works.  Whenever possible, Mr. Gardner rehearses and conducts performances of his music, providing compositional insight and interpretation from the composer’s point-of-view. His interests also include speaking with students and aspiring artists about self-publishing, music composition, and the confident pursuit of musical interests.

In addition to being a composer passionate about the benefits of self-publishing, Mr. Gardner is the director of Freedom Voices, an a cappella chamber choir dedicated to the service of military veterans and their families. He has remained active as a performer by singing in all the organizations with which he is associated, even venturing into new territory by learning to sing Barbershop. 

Mr. Gardner earned his undergraduate degree in music composition and theory from the University of Nebraska at Omaha. He studied composition primarily with Dr. W. Kenton Bales, and has performed extensively under the direction of Dr. Z. Randall Stroope, Dr. James Saker, and Dr. Cina Crisara.  He completed his Master of Science in Music Technology degree at Indiana University Purdue University Indianapolis, a unique program that leverages expertise from both the Indiana University Department of Music and the Purdue School of Engineering and Technology.

When not composing music, Mr. Gardner spends as much time as he can with his four amazing children and his equally amazing and beautiful wife, Laura.
