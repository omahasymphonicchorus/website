Among his many interests, Dr. Zielke enjoys conducting choral festivals, adjudicating music contests, and leading workshops on music and worship. He served as the Artistic Director for Voices of Omaha for seven years and is currently the Director of Music at Community Bible Church in Omaha. His conducting début at Carnegie Hall came in 2009 with a chorus of 160 singing Haydn’s “Te Deum.”
