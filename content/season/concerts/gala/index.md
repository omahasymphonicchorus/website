Members of the Omaha Symphonic Chorus will sweep you off to New York City with tunes from *A Chorus Line*, *Phantom of the Opera*, *The Producers*, *Spamalot*, and many other Broadway musicals performed by soloists, duets, quartets, and an ensemble of fifty OSC members.

The afternoon performance will be the show with general seating.

The evening performance will be the same show as a gala with heavy hors d'oeuvres along with silent and live auctions. Seating will be at tables of six.
